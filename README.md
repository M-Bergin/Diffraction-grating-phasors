# diffraction-grating-phasors
MATLAB code to visualise how the phasor diagram from a diffraction grating behaves. 

Variables at the top can be used to control the wavevector and amplitude of the wave in addition to the number of slits in the diffraction grating and the distance between them.

Can uncomment some of the code near the bottom to generate a movie if needed.
